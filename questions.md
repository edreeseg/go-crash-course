### Questions to Answer

1. Why is my else if not working if a newline is added between the conditions?
   - Because Golang has automatic semicolon insertion under the hood, so when it sees `}` without another conditional being started, it inserts a semicolon, breaking the chain.
2. Why does rand.Intn() continue to return the same number when run multiple times?
   - Random numbers are generated by a Source. By default, these values use a default shared Source that produces a set, already determined set of values. If you need to randomize values between runs, you need to seed the default Source using a seed function, e.g. rand.Seed(time.Now().UTC().UnixNano())
3. When is it especially useful to use an interface as opposed to defining a method on a struct? Presumably when there will be many structs needing the same methods, but do research to fully understand.
